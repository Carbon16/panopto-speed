# PanoptoSpeed

PanoptoSpeed is a firefox add-on that lets you play videos at whatever speed you want (within reason). I made it to watch my lectures at an ungodly speed, while I was procrastinating watching those same lectures.

## Installation

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hyperpanoptospeed/

## Usage

You drag the slider and pray you can take it in......
Not rocket science. (If your lectures are on rocket science, then I'm sorry. Just in general.)

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, although I can't imagine what else you'd want to add.

Tests?! What are those??
